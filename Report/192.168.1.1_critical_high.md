### üîê Critical Vulnerability on `192.168.1.1`

**Vulnerability:**  
**SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection**

**Severity:** Critical  
**CVE:** General protocol flaw (No CVE)

**Description:**  
The router allows connections using **SSL 2.0** and/or **SSL 3.0** ‚Äî both deprecated and insecure. These legacy protocols are vulnerable to:

- **CBC padding attacks**
- **POODLE downgrade attacks**
- **Session renegotiation flaws**

Even modern browsers and clients that support TLS 1.2/1.3 can be forced to downgrade, enabling **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** and **traffic decryption** attacks.

**Fix Recommendation:**  
Disable **SSL v2** and **SSL v3** protocols in the router configuration. Enforce **TLS 1.2** or **TLS 1.3** with strong cipher suites.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High Vulnerability on `192.168.1.1`

**Vulnerability:**  
**SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)**

**Severity:** High  
**Plugin ID:** 42873  
**CVE:** (Applies generally to block cipher attacks)

**Description:**  
The router supports **medium-strength ciphers**, notably **3DES**, which uses 64-bit block size. This opens the door for:

- **SWEET32 attacks**, where prolonged encrypted sessions leak plaintext.
- Session hijacking in shared network environments (e.g., Wi-Fi)

This vulnerability primarily impacts **long-lived sessions** with predictable data (like cookies), especially if intercepted on LAN.

**Fix Recommendation:**  
- Disable **3DES** and other ciphers with < 112-bit security.
- Allow only **strong modern ciphers**, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
